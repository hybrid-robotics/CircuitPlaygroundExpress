You will find various things I have coded for Adafruit's Circuit Playground Express here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accelerometer_Eight_Way.py		Uses the accelerometer to detect eight directions
					It also uses the NeoPixels to highlight each of
						directions. BLUE is level, GREEN are the
						four major directions, and PURPLE are the
						directions in between the main ones.
